# Server Heartbeat Detector

## Introduction

**serverheartbeat** in server mode waits for heartbeats sent as UDP messages to the port specified.
Whenever a client comes up / goes down, a notification email is sent.

In client mode, it simply sends heartbeats to the server.

## Installation

Use the enclosed minipex.sh script to create a binary. It just needs to be run
- e.g. from /etc/rc.local.

Also make sure the server has a working email server.

## Caveats

This script is intentionally very basic, all timeouts, logfile location, etc
hardcoded. Fits the purpose though :)
